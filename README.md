# BITS-Nightly

BITS Nightly is a console application, meant to work in conjunction with Task Scheduler, to automatically period backup via "copy and paste" into a cloud synchronized folder (ie. Google Drive). This was used to backup Microsoft Access databases as they were unable to be hosted in Google Drive.

## Functionality

The App.config will allow for either folder or file level backups to be selected, and is set to work with an SMTP server to notify users whether the backup was successful or not.
